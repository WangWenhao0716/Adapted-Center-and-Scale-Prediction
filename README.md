The codes are about my paper [**Adapted Center and Scale Prediction: More stable and More Accurate**](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09053>). This is the pytorch implementation. However, because my paper is based on [**High-level Semantic Feature Detection: A New Perspective for Pedestrian Detection**](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02948>) and this is my first try to begin a computer vision project, I choose to use and change the codes from [**CSP PyTorch Implementation**](<https://github.com/lw396285v/CSP-pedestrian-detection-in-pytorch>). Many thanks for his contributionÔºÅ

Welcome to [**my website**](<https://wangwenhao0716.github.io/>)

# ACSP PyTorch Implementation

## Requirement
* Python 3.6
* Pytorch 0.4.1.post2
* Numpy 1.16.0
* OpenCV 3.4.2
* Torchvision 0.2.0

## Reproduction Environment
* Test our models: One GPU with about 4G memory.
* Train new models: Two GPUs with 32G memory per GPU.(If you do not have enough GPU memory resources, please resize the input to 640x1280, it yields slightly worse performance, though.)

## Installation
You can directly get the codes by:
```
  git clone https://github.com/WangWenhao0716/Adapted-Center-and-Scale-Prediction.git
```

## Preparation
1. CityPersons Dataset

You should download the dataset from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/). From that link, leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) is used. We use the training set(2975 images) for training and the validation set(500 images) for test. The data should be stored in `./data/citypersons/images`. Annotations have already prepared for you. And the directory structure will be 
```
*DATA_PATH
	*images
		*train
			*aachen
			*bochum
			...
		*val
			*frankfurt
			*lindau
			*munster
		*test
			*berlin
			*bielefeld
			...
	*annotations
		*anno_train.mat
		*anno_val.mat
		...
```


2. Pretrained Models

The backbone of our ACSP is modified ResNet-101, i.e. replacing all BN layers with SN layers. You can download the pretrained model from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rK-ukAjEIPql2ECi38hRbQ). It is provided by the author of [Switchable Normalization](https://github.com/switchablenorms/Switchable-Normalization). The weights will be stored in `./models/`.

3. Our Trained Models

We provide two models:

[ACSP(Smooth L1)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p2IF7nI6dOhpmSvXLFsxlA)(code: ydc1): **Reasonable 10.0%; Heavy 46.1%; Partial 8.8%; Bare 6.7%**.

[ACSP(Vanilla L1)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zZP3brc1FvMrcmPo7Fx-Tg)(code: 4oa2): **Reasonable 9.3%; Heavy 46.3%; Partial 8.7%; Bare 5.6%**.

They should be stored in `./models/`.

4. Compile Libraries

Before running the codes, you must compile the libraries. The followings should be accomplished in terminal. If you are not sure about what it means, click [here](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/) may be helpful.

```
cd util
make all
```


## Training

`python train.py`

or

`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=x,x python train.py --gpu_id 0 1`

## Test

`python test.py`
